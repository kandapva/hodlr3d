## Purpose

This page is mainly setup in light to provide a set of supplementary images that help understand the Theorem provided n the article. Also this page serves as a one stop place for the hierarchical low-rank structure HODLR3D.

## Features

In the article, 
* We prove[Theorem](https://kandapva.github.io/hodlr3d/theorem/), the basis for building the new hierarchical matrix representation. 
* We also illustrate numerically the scaling of ranks of different off-diagonal blocks.
* Based on the outcomes of [Theorem](https://kandapva.github.io/hodlr3d/theorem/) and the numerical illustrations, we build the HODLR3D representation, wherein we only choose to compress the off-diagonal blocks corresponding to interactions between vertex sharing neighbors and well-separated boxes of the hierarchical tree, to achieve an almost linear complexity algorithm. 
* We perform various numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of HODLR3D matrix-vector product.
