# Abstract

In the article, we introduce HODLR3D, a new class of hierarchical matrices arising out of $$ N $$ body problems in three dimensions. It is an analogous to [HODLR2D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05536) in three dimensions. 
We state and prove a theorem, the foundation for the HODLR3D structure, that describes the scaling of ranks of certain sub blocks of the matrix for the 3D Laplace kernel, which can be generalized to other kernel functions too. 
Further we leverage the low-rank structure of the matrix, to construct the HODLR3D representation of the matrix and to accelerate matrix-vector products. The computational complexity of HODLR3D matrix-vector product is $$ \mathcal{O}(pN\log(N))$$, where $$p\in \mathcal{O}(\log^{2}(N))$$. Further we demonstrate the performance of HODLR3D through numerical experiments.
